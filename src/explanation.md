**1.What is a "hook" in react?**

A “hook” is a special function that allows functional components to have features previously only available in class components.

Most common hooks include:

- “*useState*”: Allows adding local state to functional components.

- “*useEffect*”: Enables the execution of side effects in functional components, such as data requests, subscriptions, or manual DOM modifications.

- “*useContext*”: Allows subscribing to React context data without needing to use a Consumer.

- “*useReducer*”: An alternative to “*useState*” for managing more complex states or more intricate update logic.

The introduction of hooks in React has simplified components writing and reduced repetitive code.

**2. What is jsx? What is actually going on "under the hood"?**

JSX is a syntactic extension of JS used by React to describe what the UI should look like. Although it appears similar to HTML, it is actually *syntactic sugar** for calling React functions. JSX is transformed by Babel into calls to “React.createElement”.

Under the hood, each JSX tag is converted into a call to “React.createElement()”, which returns JS objects known as “React elements”. These elements describe the component tree and DOM nodes that React will subsequently construct.

    <div>Hello</div>

is the same as

    React.createElement(“div”, null, “Hello”).

This transformation allows React to construct a virtual element tree that it manages in memory. This virtual tree is used to efficiently update the actual browser DOM by comparing it with new versions of the tree when the application state changes.

**3. What problem does react solve?**

React was designed to address specific challenges in the development of large-scale applications, where efficient management and updating of the DOM can be significant obstacles due to performance costs.

Principal problems that React helps to solve include:

- *DOM Update Performance*: React introduces the concept of the “Virtual DOM”, which allows making minimal differences (“diffs”) between the current state of the DOM and the new state it should have. This means that React can selectively update only the parts of the DOM that actually need updating, significantly improving performance.

- *Components Reusability*: React encourages the creation of components that are encapsulated and reusable across different parts of an application or even between different projects.

- *Complex State Management*: With its component-based architecture and the use of state and props, React facilitates the management of complex states in interactive applications, allowing better code organization and easier maintenance.

- *Declarative Development*: React allows you to describe the UI in a declarative way, which makes the code more predictable and easier to debug. It focuses on describing how UI should appear in a given state, not how it changes over time.

These features make React a powerful and flexible tool for developing modern, efficient web and mobile user interfaces.


***Syntatic Sugar:** In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.
